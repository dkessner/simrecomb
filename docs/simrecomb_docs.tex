\section{Introduction}


\texttt{simrecomb} is a command-line program for simulating recombination and
admixture among multiple populations over multiple non-overlapping generations.
The user can specify population sizes, admixture rules for each population in
each generation, and genetic maps for recombination rates along chromosomes.
Individuals are diploid, and can have multiple chromosomes.  Individual
chromosome blocks are tracked during the course of the simulation, with
identifiers specifying the exact ancestral individual from which the block is
derived.
